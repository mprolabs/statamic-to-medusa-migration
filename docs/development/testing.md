# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing approach for the Saleor migration project, covering backend, frontend, and integration aspects.

## Levels of Testing

1.  **Unit Testing:**
    *   **Backend (Saleor):** Focus on testing custom plugins, services, or complex logic added beyond Saleor core. Use `pytest`.
    *   **Frontend (Next.js):** Test individual React components, utility functions, and hooks using `jest` and `@testing-library/react`. Mock API calls.
    *   **CMS (if custom logic):** Test any custom API endpoints or services added to the Headless CMS.

2.  **Integration Testing:**
    *   **API Integration:** Test interactions between the Next.js frontend and the Saleor GraphQL API. Verify data fetching, mutations (e.g., add to cart, checkout), and error handling. Can use tools like `@testing-library/react` with mock service workers (`msw`) or run against a live test Saleor instance.
    *   **CMS Integration:** Test interactions between Next.js and the Headless CMS API for fetching content.
    *   **Saleor <> CMS:** If there's direct interaction (e.g., webhooks), test these flows.

3.  **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:**
    *   **Framework:** Use Cypress or Playwright.
    *   **Scope:** Simulate real user journeys across the frontend application, interacting with live (or near-live test environment) backend services (Saleor, CMS).
    *   **Key Scenarios:**
        *   Product browsing and filtering (per channel/region).
        *   Adding items to cart.
        *   Full checkout process (including address entry, shipping selection, simulated payment) for each region/currency/language combination.
        *   User login and account management.
        *   Language switching.
        *   Content page navigation.

4.  **Manual Testing / QA:**
    *   **Cross-Browser/Device Testing:** Verify layout and functionality on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and device sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
    *   **Exploratory Testing:** Unscripted testing to find edge cases and usability issues.
    *   **Accessibility Testing:** Use tools (like Axe DevTools) and manual checks (keyboard navigation, screen reader) to ensure WCAG compliance.
    *   **Multi-Region/Language Validation:** Manually verify content, pricing, currency, taxes, and language for each supported region/domain.

## Tools & Frameworks

*   **Backend Unit:** `pytest`
*   **Frontend Unit/Integration:** `jest`, `@testing-library/react`, `msw`
*   **E2E:** Cypress or Playwright
*   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (to run tests automatically)

## Process

1.  **Write Unit Tests:** Developers write unit tests alongside feature development.
2.  **Write Integration Tests:** Focus on critical API interactions.
3.  **Develop E2E Tests:** Create E2E test suites for key user flows.
4.  **CI Integration:** Configure GitHub Actions to run unit, integration, and potentially E2E tests on pull requests and merges.
5.  **Manual QA:** Perform manual testing cycles before major releases or deployments, focusing on areas not covered by automated tests.
