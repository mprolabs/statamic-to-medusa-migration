# Data Migration

This section details the strategy and process for migrating existing data from the Statamic CMS and Simple Commerce setup to the new Saleor platform.

## Key Considerations

*   **Data Mapping:** Defining clear mappings between Statamic fields/collections and Saleor attributes/models.
*   **Transformation:** Handling differences in data structures, formats (e.g., dates, rich text), and relationships.
*   **Validation:** Ensuring data integrity and completeness after migration.
*   **Scripting:** Developing reusable scripts for extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).

## Process

1.  **Analyze Source Data:** Identify all relevant data types (products, categories, users, orders, content blocks).
2.  **Develop Mapping Document:** Create a detailed spreadsheet mapping source fields to target Saleor fields.
3.  **Create Extraction Scripts:** Write scripts to export data from Statamic (likely using Statamic's API or direct file access if needed).
4.  **Create Transformation Scripts:** Develop scripts to clean, reformat, and restructure the extracted data according to the mapping document.
5.  **Create Loading Scripts:** Write scripts using Saleor's API (GraphQL mutations) to import the transformed data.
6.  **Test Migration:** Perform test runs with sample data, validate results thoroughly.
7.  **Full Migration Run:** Execute scripts for the complete dataset during the planned migration window.
8.  **Post-Migration Validation:** Perform extensive checks on the live Saleor instance.
