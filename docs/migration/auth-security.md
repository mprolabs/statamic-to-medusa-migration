# Authentication & Security Requirements

This document outlines the authentication mechanisms, authorization rules, rate limiting, and security considerations for API access in the Saleor migration project.

## Authentication Methods

### JWT Authentication

Saleor uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) as the primary authentication mechanism:

```graphql
mutation TokenCreate($email: String!, $password: String!) {
  tokenCreate(email: $email, password: $password) {
    token
    refreshToken
    errors {
      field
      message
      code
    }
    user {
      id
      email
    }
  }
}
```

#### Token Structure

- **Access Token**: Short-lived token (24 hours) for API access
- **Refresh Token**: Long-lived token (30 days) to obtain new access tokens

#### Token Refresh Flow

```graphql
mutation RefreshToken($refreshToken: String!) {
  tokenRefresh(refreshToken: $refreshToken) {
    token
    errors {
      field
      message
      code
    }
  }
}
```

### External Authentication

For integration with existing authentication systems:

1. **OAuth 2.0 Support**:
   - Auth0 integration
   - Custom OAuth provider integration

2. **Social Authentication**:
   - Google
   - Facebook
   - Apple Sign-In

## Authorization Rules

### Permission Levels

| Role | Description | Access Level |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Anonymous | Unauthenticated visitors | Read-only access to public content |
| Customer | Registered shoppers | Access to own orders and account |
| Staff | Backend operators | Limited admin access based on permissions |
| Admin | Full system administrators | Complete access to all resources |

### Permission Groups

Staff users will be organized into permission groups with specific access rights:

1. **Order Managers**:
   - View and manage orders
   - Process payments and refunds
   - View customer information

2. **Catalog Managers**:
   - Create and manage products, categories
   - Manage inventory and pricing
   - Upload product media

3. **Content Editors**:
   - Manage translations
   - Edit product descriptions
   - Manage blog and marketing content

4. **System Administrators**:
   - Full system access
   - Manage users and permissions
   - Configure system settings

### Permission Checking

API requests are validated against the user's permission set:

```graphql
query {
  me {
    id
    email
    userPermissions {
      code
      name
    }
  }
}
```

## Rate Limiting Strategy

### Request Limits

| User Type | Request Limit | Window |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| Anonymous | 100 requests | Per minute |
| Authenticated | 300 requests | Per minute |
| Staff/Admin | 1000 requests | Per minute |

### Implementation

1. **Rate Limit Headers**:
   ```
   X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
   X-RateLimit-Remaining: 95
   X-RateLimit-Reset: 1620000000
   ```

2. **Throttling Response**:
   - HTTP Status: 429 Too Many Requests
   - Body: `{"message": "Rate limit exceeded. Try again in X seconds."}`

3. **Burst Allowance**:
   - Short burst of traffic allowed beyond the regular rate
   - Helps handle legitimate traffic spikes

## Security Requirements

### HTTPS Enforcement

- All API communications must use HTTPS
- HTTP requests will be automatically redirected to HTTPS
- HSTS headers will be implemented:
  ```
  Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
  ```

### Input Validation

1. **GraphQL Validation**:
   - Type checking for all input values
   - Custom validators for domain-specific rules

2. **Sanitization**:
   - HTML content sanitization for rich text fields
   - Strict validation for email addresses and phone numbers

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Structured error responses
   - Non-revealing error messages in production

### Protection Against Common Vulnerabilities

1. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**:
   - Content-Security-Policy headers
   - Input sanitization
   - Output encoding

2. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**:
   - Token-based protection
   - SameSite cookie attributes

3. **SQL Injection**:
   - Parameterized queries
   - ORM usage with proper escaping

4. **API Security**:
   - GraphQL depth and complexity limits
   - Query cost analysis
   - Introspection disabled in production

### Data Protection

1. **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**:
   - Encryption at rest for sensitive data
   - Minimal data collection principle
   - GDPR compliance

2. **Payment Information**:
   - PCI DSS compliance
   - No storage of full card details
   - Integration with secure payment processors

3. **Data Retention**:
   - Clear policies for data retention periods
   - Secure data deletion procedures

## API Key Management

### API Key Creation

```graphql
mutation CreateAppToken($name: String!, $permissions: [PermissionEnum!]) {
  appTokenCreate(input: {
    name: $name,
    app: "APP_ID",
    permissions: $permissions
  }) {
    appToken {
      id
      name
      authToken
    }
    errors {
      field
      message
      code
    }
  }
}
```

### Key Lifecycle Management

1. **Key Rotation**:
   - Regular rotation schedule (90 days)
   - Immediate rotation on security incidents

2. **Revocation**:
   ```graphql
   mutation RevokeToken($id: ID!) {
     appTokenDelete(id: $id) {
       errors {
         field
         message
         code
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Audit logs for key usage
   - Alerts for unusual access patterns

## Multi-Region Security Considerations

### Data Residency

- Customer data will be stored in compliance with regional regulations
- EU customer data will remain in EU-based storage

### Region-Specific Authentication

- Support for region-specific authentication providers
- Compliance with local authentication requirements

## Monitoring and Incident Response

### Security Monitoring

1. **Logging**:
   - API access logs with context (user, IP, resource)
   - Authentication events (success/failure)
   - Admin actions on sensitive data

2. **Alerting**:
   - Unusual access patterns
   - Multiple failed authentication attempts
   - Suspicious activity detection

### Incident Response

1. **Response Plan**:
   - Defined roles and responsibilities
   - Communication protocols
   - Containment and recovery procedures

2. **Post-Incident Analysis**:
   - Root cause analysis
   - Security improvement recommendations
   - Documentation updates

## Migration Security Considerations

### Secure Data Transfer

- Encrypted data transfer between Statamic and Saleor
- Secure temporary storage of migration data
- Access controls during migration process

### User Password Migration

- One-way hashing for all passwords
- Password reset requirement on first login after migration
- Secure migration token generation

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Configure JWT authentication in Saleor
- [ ] Set up permission groups matching our authorization model
- [ ] Implement rate limiting at infrastructure level
- [ ] Configure HTTPS and security headers
- [ ] Establish API key management procedures
- [ ] Set up security monitoring and logging
