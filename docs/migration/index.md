# Migration Process

This section outlines the comprehensive migration strategy from Statamic CMS with Simple Commerce to Saleor, with a focus on preserving and enhancing multi-region and multi-language capabilities.

## Migration Overview

The migration follows these key phases:

1. **Assessment & Planning**
2. **Environment Setup**
3. **Data Modeling & Mapping**
4. **Data Migration**
5. **Frontend Development**
6. **Testing & Validation**
7. **Deployment & Go-Live**

## Current System Analysis

The current Statamic-based system includes:

- **CMS**: Statamic as the content management system
- **E-commerce**: Simple Commerce for product management and checkout
- **Frontend**: Laravel Blade templates with Vue.js components
- **Database**: MySQL database for data storage
- **Multi-site**: Limited multi-site capabilities through Statamic's multi-site feature
- **Languages**: Basic multi-language support

## Target System Architecture

The target Saleor-based system includes:

- **E-commerce**: Saleor Core with Channels feature for multi-region support
- **Frontend**: Next.js-based storefront with advanced routing for multiple domains
- **APIs**: GraphQL API for communication between frontend and backend
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for data storage
- **Multi-region**: Comprehensive multi-region support via Saleor Channels
- **Multi-language**: Advanced language capabilities throughout the platform

## Migration Methodology

### 1. Data Extraction

The first step is to extract all relevant data from the current Statamic system:

- Product catalog with all variants and attributes
- Categories and collections
- Customer data and order history
- CMS content including pages, blog posts, and media
- Site configuration and settings
- URL structures for SEO preservation

Data extraction tools include:

- Custom PHP scripts to access Statamic's data structures
- Database exports for structured data
- API calls for programmatically accessible data
- File system operations for assets and media

### 2. Data Transformation

The extracted data needs to be transformed to match Saleor's data models:

- Mapping Statamic product structure to Saleor's product model
- Converting content to appropriate formats for the new system
- Transforming customer and order data to match Saleor's schemas
- Preparing data with appropriate language variants
- Adding channel-specific data for multi-region support

### 3. Data Loading

Processed data is loaded into the Saleor system through:

- GraphQL mutations for structured data
- Saleor's import/export APIs for bulk operations
- Custom import scripts for complex data structures
- Media asset import to appropriate storage

### 4. Multi-Region Configuration

Special attention is given to setting up the multi-region capabilities:

- Creating appropriate Channels in Saleor (Netherlands, Belgium, Germany)
- Configuring region-specific settings (currencies, taxes, shipping)
- Setting up channel-specific product visibility and pricing
- Establishing domain-specific routing

### 5. Multi-Language Implementation

Language support is implemented through:

- Product translations in Saleor
- Content translations for all static content
- Language-specific SEO metadata
- Frontend components for language switching
- Language detection and persistence mechanisms

## Migration Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Data Model Differences

**Solution**: Comprehensive mapping between Statamic and Saleor data models, with transformation scripts to handle structural differences.

### Challenge: URL Structure Preservation

**Solution**: Custom routing implementation in Next.js to preserve existing URL structures for SEO, with appropriate redirects for changed URLs.

### Challenge: Multi-Region Data

**Solution**: Channel-specific data imports with region context preserved throughout the migration process.

### Challenge: User Accounts and Orders

**Solution**: Secure migration of user data with appropriate hashing, preserving order history with region context.

### Challenge: Content Relationships

**Solution**: Relationship mapping to preserve connections between content types, products, and other entities.

## Migration Timeline

The migration is scheduled to proceed as follows:

1. **Assessment Phase**: 2 weeks
2. **Environment Setup**: 1 week
3. **Data Modeling & Mapping**: 3 weeks
4. **Migration Script Development**: 4 weeks
5. **Test Migration**: 2 weeks
6. **Frontend Development**: 6 weeks (parallel with migration development)
7. **Integration Testing**: 3 weeks
8. **Performance Optimization**: 2 weeks
9. **User Acceptance Testing**: 2 weeks
10. **Go-Live Preparation**: 1 week
11. **Deployment and Go-Live**: 1 week

## Risk Mitigation

To minimize risks during the migration:

- Development and testing occur in isolated environments
- Multiple test migrations are performed before the final migration
- Comprehensive backup strategy for all source data
- Detailed rollback plan in case of unexpected issues
- Thorough testing across all regions and languages
- Phased go-live approach if necessary
