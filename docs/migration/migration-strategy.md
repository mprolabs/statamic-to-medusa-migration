## Migration Strategies

### 1. Parallel Development Strategy

The new Saleor system will be developed in parallel with the legacy system:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Legacy
        LBack[Backend]
        LFront[Frontend]
        LDB[(Database)]
    end
    
    subgraph Saleor
        SaleorAPI[Saleor API]
        NextJS[Next.js Frontend]
        SaleorDB[(Saleor Database)]
    end
    
    LBack --> LFront
    LBack --> LDB
    
    SaleorAPI --> NextJS
    SaleorAPI --> SaleorDB
    
    Migration[Data Migration] --> SaleorDB
    LDB --> Migration
    
    style Legacy fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    style Saleor fill:#e6f7ff,stroke:#0088cc,stroke-width:1px
    style Migration fill:#fff0e6,stroke:#ff6600,stroke-width:1px
```

This approach allows:
- Independent development of the new system
- Thorough testing before cutover
- Minimal disruption to the existing system
- Ability to roll back if critical issues arise

### 2. Phased Feature Migration

Features will be migrated in priority order:

1. Core e-commerce functionality (product catalog, search, cart, checkout)
2. Customer accounts and order history
3. Content and marketing features
4. Advanced features (recommendations, personalization)

### 3. Hybrid Transition Period

During the transition, a hybrid approach may be employed:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    User((User))
    
    subgraph Routing
        Direction[Traffic Direction]
    end
    
    subgraph Legacy
        LOld[Legacy Pages]
    end
    
    subgraph Saleor
        SNew[Saleor Pages]
    end
    
    User --> Direction
    Direction --> LOld
    Direction --> SNew
    
    style User fill:#f5f5f5,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    style Routing fill:#fff0e6,stroke:#ff6600,stroke-width:1px
    style Legacy fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    style Saleor fill:#e6f7ff,stroke:#0088cc,stroke-width:1px
```

This allows:
- Gradual migration of traffic
- Testing with real users
- Feature-by-feature migration
- Immediate rollback capability

## Data Migration Strategy

The data migration will follow these key principles:

### 1. Data Mapping

Comprehensive mapping between legacy data models and Saleor models.

### 2. Data Transformation

Custom scripts will transform data from legacy formats to Saleor formats.

### 3. Data Validation

Rigorous validation procedures to ensure data integrity.

### 4. Migration Sequence

Data will be migrated in a specific sequence to maintain referential integrity:

1. Products and Categories
2. Customer Data
3. Order History
4. Reviews and UGC
5. Content and Media

### 5. Incremental Migration

Where possible, data will be migrated incrementally to reduce risk and allow for validation.

## Risk Management

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| **Data Loss or Corruption** | Critical | Low | Multiple backups, thorough testing, validation procedures |
| **Extended Downtime** | High | Low | Parallel operation, phased cutover, thorough testing |
| **Performance Issues** | High | Medium | Performance testing, scalability planning, infrastructure optimization |
| **Feature Parity Gaps** | Medium | Medium | Comprehensive requirements gathering, priority-based development |
| **Integration Failures** | High | Medium | Early integration testing, fallback mechanisms |
| **User Adoption Issues** | Medium | Low | Training, clear communication, UX focus in development |
| **SEO Impact** | High | Medium | URL preservation, redirects, SEO monitoring |

## Technical Delivery Approach

The technical implementation will follow these principles:

### 1. API-First Development

- Saleor GraphQL API as the foundation
- Clear API contracts between frontend and backend
- Comprehensive API testing

### 2. Component-Based Frontend

- Reusable React components
- Clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive component testing

### 3. Continuous Integration & Deployment

- Automated testing on each commit
- Automated deployment pipelines
- Environment parity

### 4. Feature Flags

- Ability to enable/disable features
- A/B testing capabilities
- Gradual feature rollout
