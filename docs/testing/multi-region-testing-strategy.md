# Multi-Region and Multi-Language Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for ensuring proper implementation of multi-region and multi-language functionality in the Saleor migration.

## 1. Testing Goals

- Verify correct implementation of region-specific functionality
- Ensure proper language handling across all supported languages
- Validate data integrity during and after migration
- Confirm user experience consistency across regions and languages
- Test region-specific business rules and pricing

## 2. Testing Levels

| Product Information | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Checkout Process | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Email Templates | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Legal Documents | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Error Messages | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

### 3.3 Channel-Language Combination Matrix

Test critical paths in all valid channel-language combinations:

| Channel | Dutch (nl) | English (en) | German (de) | French (fr) |
|---------|------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Netherlands (nl) | Primary | Secondary | - | - |
| Belgium (be) | Primary | Secondary | - | Primary |
| Germany (de) | - | Secondary | Primary | - |

## 4. Migration-Specific Testing

### 4.1 Data Validation Tests

| Test Type | Description | Success Criteria |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| Product Count | Compare product counts before and after migration | 100% match |
| Translation Completeness | Verify all translatable fields are migrated | 100% coverage |
| Region Availability | Validate product availability in correct regions | 100% accuracy |
| Price Consistency | Compare prices across regions and with source data | 100% accuracy |
| Media Migration | Verify all media files are correctly linked | 100% coverage |

### 4.2 Performance Testing

| Test Type | Metrics | Acceptance Criteria |
|-----------|---------|---------------------|
| Page Load Time | Average load time by region | < 2 seconds |
| API Response Time | Response time with region/language filtering | < 200ms |
| Region Switching | Time to switch between regions | < 1 second |
| Language Switching | Time to switch languages | < 500ms |
| Search Performance | Search response time by region/language | < 500ms |

## 5. Test Automation Strategy

### 5.1 Automated Testing Setup

```javascript
// Example test structure for region detection
describe('Region Detection', () => {
  test('detects NL region from nl.domain.com', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
  
  test('detects BE region from be.domain.com', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
  
  test('falls back to default region when no subdomain', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});

// Example test structure for multi-language product display
describe('Product Display with Language Context', () => {
  test('displays Dutch content when language is set to NL', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
  
  test('displays English content when language is set to EN', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

### 5.2 Continuous Integration

- Run unit and integration tests on every pull request
- Run full end-to-end test suite nightly
- Run migration validation tests prior to production deployment
- Implement visual regression testing for UI across languages

## 6. Manual Testing Checklist

### 6.1 Region-Specific Functionality

- [ ] Verify correct domain routing to appropriate region storefronts
- [ ] Confirm region-specific product catalog is displayed
- [ ] Test region detection from IP address and user preferences
- [ ] Validate shipping options are correctly limited by region
- [ ] Verify payment methods appropriate to each region
- [ ] Test region-specific tax calculations
- [ ] Confirm promotional rules apply correctly by region

### 6.2 Language-Specific Functionality

- Selected customers (beta testers)

## 8. Rollout and Monitoring

### 8.1 Phased Rollout Plan
