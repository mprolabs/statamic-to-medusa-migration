# Monitoring and Logging Requirements

This document outlines the monitoring and logging requirements for the Saleor e-commerce platform with multi-region and multi-language capabilities.

## Monitoring Strategy

The monitoring strategy follows a multi-layered approach to ensure comprehensive visibility:

- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Track the health and performance of cloud resources
- **Application Monitoring**: Monitor application performance and errors
- **Business Metrics**: Track key business indicators and user activity
- **Synthetic Monitoring**: Regularly test critical user flows
- **Alerting**: Notify appropriate teams of potential issues
- **Dashboards**: Provide visual representation of system health

## Monitoring Tool Selection: AWS CloudWatch + Datadog

A hybrid monitoring approach has been selected for comprehensive coverage:

- **AWS CloudWatch**: For core AWS infrastructure monitoring
- **Datadog**: For application performance monitoring, tracing, and business metrics

### Justification for Hybrid Approach

| Capability | CloudWatch | Datadog | Selected Tool |
|------------|------------|---------|---------------|
| AWS Infrastructure | Native integration | Limited depth | CloudWatch |
| Multi-cloud Support | AWS-only | Comprehensive | Datadog |
| Application Metrics | Basic | Advanced | Datadog |
| Distributed Tracing | Minimal | Extensive | Datadog |
| Custom Business Metrics | Limited | Advanced | Datadog |
| Cost | Lower for AWS metrics | Higher but more features | Hybrid |
| Unified Alerting | Limited | Advanced | Datadog |
| ML-based Anomaly Detection | Basic | Advanced | Datadog |

## Infrastructure Monitoring

|-----------|---------|-----------|----------------|
| **Saleor API** | Response time > 300ms<br>Error rate > 1%<br>Request rate change > 50% | 5min<br>5min<br>15min | High<br>Critical<br>Medium |
| **Storefront** | Page load > 2s<br>TTFB > 600ms<br>Error rate > 1% | 15min<br>10min<br>5min | Medium<br>Medium<br>High |
| **Dashboard** | Response time > 500ms<br>Error rate > 2% | 15min<br>15min | Low<br>Medium |
| **Background Jobs** | Success rate < 98%<br>Processing time > 30s | 15min<br>15min | Medium<br>Low |

### Distributed Tracing

End-to-end tracing will be implemented using Datadog APM:

- **Instrumentation**: OpenTelemetry for all application components
- **Sampling Rate**: 10% of requests, with 100% for critical transactions
- **Retention**: 15 days for sampled traces
- **Service Map**: Auto-generated based on trace data
- **Integration Points**:
  - GraphQL operations
  - Database queries
  - External API calls
  - Cache operations
  - Background jobs

### Real User Monitoring (RUM)

User experience monitoring for the storefront and dashboard:

- **Core Web Vitals**: LCP, FID, CLS metrics
- **Session Replay**: Anonymous session recording for troubleshooting (GDPR compliant)
- **Error Tracking**: JavaScript errors with stack traces
- **Geographic Performance**: Performance metrics by region
- **User Journey Analytics**: Conversion funnels and user flows

## Business Metrics

Key business indicators to monitor:

| Category | Metrics | Goal |
|----------|---------|------|
| **Sales** | Orders per hour<br>Revenue per region<br>Average order value | Region-specific targets |
| **User Activity** | Active users<br>Cart abandonment<br>Conversion rate | Growing trend |
| **Inventory** | Stock levels<br>Out-of-stock events | Minimize stockouts |
| **Search** | Search usage<br>Zero results rate | <5% zero results |
| **Performance** | Checkout completion time<br>Time to interactive | <30s checkout |

## Synthetic Monitoring

Automated testing of critical user journeys:

| Journey | Frequency | Regions | Alert Threshold |
|---------|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| Homepage Load | 5min | All | >3s or error |
| Product Search | 15min | All | >5s or error |
| Add to Cart | 15min | All | >2s or error |
| Checkout Flow | 30min | All | >30s or error |
| User Login | 15min | All | >3s or error |
| Admin Login | 30min | Primary | >3s or error |

## Logging Strategy

### Log Sources and Types

| Source | Log Types | Retention |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Application** | Error<br>Info<br>Debug | 30 days<br>14 days<br>3 days |
| **Access** | Web server access<br>API requests | 90 days |
| **Security** | Authentication<br>Authorization | 1 year |
| **Infrastructure** | AWS CloudTrail<br>VPC Flow Logs | 90 days |
| **Database** | Slow query<br>Error logs | 30 days |
| **Audit** | Data modifications<br>Config changes | 1 year |

### Log Collection Architecture

Logs will be collected and centralized using AWS CloudWatch Logs and forwarded to Datadog:

- **Agent-based Collection**: Datadog agent on EC2/EKS
- **Direct Integration**: CloudWatch Logs to Datadog
- **Custom Forwarders**: Lambda functions for specialized log processing
- **Log Formats**: Standardized JSON format for all application logs
- **Structured Logging**: Consistent field names and formats
- **Contextual Enrichment**: Add request IDs, user IDs, and region information

### Log Processing and Analysis

- **Real-time Processing**: Pattern detection and anomaly identification
- **Log Parsing Rules**: Extract structured data from logs
- **Aggregation**: Roll up similar log events to reduce noise
- **Correlation**: Link logs with traces and metrics
- **Search and Analysis**: Full-text search and field-based filtering
- **Visualization**: Log patterns and trends dashboards

## Multi-Region Considerations

### Region-Specific Monitoring

- **Regional Dashboards**: Separate dashboard views per region
- **Comparison Views**: Side-by-side metrics comparison between regions
- **Region Tags**: All metrics and logs tagged with region identifier
- **Global Overview**: Consolidated view of all regions for executive dashboards
- **Region-Specific Alerts**: Alert routing based on affected region

### Cross-Region Monitoring

- **Global Service Level Objectives (SLOs)**: Track availability and performance across all regions
- **Latency Between Regions**: Monitor network performance between regions
- **Data Replication Lag**: Track replication delays between primary and secondary regions
- **Failover Testing**: Regular automated tests of region failover mechanisms
- **Global/Regional Traffic Ratios**: Monitor traffic distribution across regions

## Alerting Strategy

### Alert Severity Levels

| Level | Response Time | Notification Methods | Escalation |
|-------|---------------|----------------------|------------|
| **Critical** | 15min | SMS, Phone, Slack, Email | If no ack in 15min |
| **High** | 30min | Slack, SMS, Email | If no ack in 30min |
| **Medium** | 2 hours | Slack, Email | If no ack in 2 hours |
| **Low** | 8 hours | Email | No automatic escalation |

### On-Call Rotation

- **Primary On-Call**: 24/7 rotation with 1-week shifts
- **Secondary On-Call**: Backup person for each shift
- **Escalation Path**: Primary → Secondary → Team Lead → Manager
- **Handover Process**: Documented process for shift changes
- **Follow-the-Sun**: Different regions handle alerts during their business hours

### Alert Noise Reduction

- **Alert Grouping**: Combine related alerts into a single notification
- **Alert Suppression**: During maintenance windows or known issues
- **Flapping Detection**: Prevent repeated alerts for unstable conditions
- **Alert Correlation**: Link related alerts to identify root causes
- **Auto-Remediation**: Automated responses for known issues

## Dashboards and Visualization

### Dashboard Hierarchy

| Dashboard Type | Audience | Update Frequency | Content |
|----------------|----------|-------------------|---------|
| **Executive** | Leadership | Daily | Business KPIs, SLAs, Availability |
| **Operational** | Operations | Real-time | System health, Alerts, Capacity |
| **Technical** | Engineers | Real-time | Detailed metrics, Logs, Traces |
| **Regional** | Regional Managers | Real-time | Region-specific metrics |
| **Service** | Service Owners | Real-time | Service-specific health |
