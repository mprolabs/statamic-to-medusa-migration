2. **Independent Security Controls**
   - Region-specific WAF configurations
   - Localized DDoS protection
   - Region-specific security monitoring

3. **Compliance Adaptations**
   - EU region: GDPR-specific controls
   - US region: CCPA/state law controls
   - Custom privacy notices per region

### Cross-Region Data Flows

For data that must flow between regions:

1. **Secure Data Transit**
   - End-to-end encryption for all cross-region traffic
   - Strong authentication for cross-region services
   - Traffic monitoring at region boundaries

2. **Data Residency Controls**
   - Clear policies on what data can cross regional boundaries
   - Technical controls enforcing data residency requirements
   - Audit logging of all cross-region data access

3. **Minimized Data Transfer**
   - Only essential data transferred between regions
   - Local processing preferred where possible
   - Anonymization of cross-region analytics data
