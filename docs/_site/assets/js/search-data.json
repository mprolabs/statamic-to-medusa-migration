Always include the channel parameter in queries to ensure region-specific data: . const GET_PRODUCTS = gql` query GetProducts($channel: String!) { products(first: 10, channel: $channel) { edges { node { id name # Other fields... } } } } `; // Usage client.query({ query: GET_PRODUCTS, variables: { channel: currentChannel // e.g., \"netherlands\" } }); . 2. Language Context in Queries . Include language code in queries when fetching translations: . const GET_PRODUCT_DETAILS = gql` query GetProductDetails($id: ID!, $channel: String!, $languageCode: LanguageCodeEnum!) { product(id: $id, channel: $channel) { id name description translation(languageCode: $languageCode) { name description } # Other fields... } } `; // Usage client.query({ query: GET_PRODUCT_DETAILS, variables: { id: productId, channel: currentChannel, languageCode: currentLanguage // e.g., \"NL\" } }); . 3. Fallback Strategies . Implement fallback strategies when translations are not available: . // Example React component using translations with fallback function ProductName({ product, languageCode }) { return ( &lt;h1&gt; {product.translation &amp;&amp; product.translation.name ? product.translation.name : product.name} &lt;/h1&gt; ); } .

    "doc": "Language Implementation",
    "title": "Implementation Steps",
    "content": "Step 1: Configure Saleor for Multi-Language Support . Saleor inherently supports translations for most entities. No special configuration is needed at the database level, but you need to create translations for your content: . | Via Dashboard: . | Navigate to a product/category/etc. | Find the “Translations” section | Click “Add translation” | Select a language and add translated content | . | Via GraphQL API: mutation { productTranslate( id: \"UHJvZHVjdDo0Nw==\", input: { languageCode: DE, name: \"Produktname auf Deutsch\", description: \"Produktbeschreibung auf Deutsch\" } ) { product { id name translations { languageCode name } } } } . | . Step 2: Configure Next.js for Multi-Language Support . Add i18n configuration to your next.config.js: . /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */ const nextConfig = { i18n: { // Define all supported locales locales: ['en', 'nl', 'de', 'fr'], // Default locale when no specific locale matches defaultLocale: 'en', // Optional: Associate domains with specific locales domains: [ { domain: 'domain-nl.com', defaultLocale: 'nl', }, { domain: 'domain-be.com', defaultLocale: 'nl', // Locales supported on this domain locales: ['nl', 'fr'], }, { domain: 'domain-de.com', defaultLocale: 'de', }, ], // Optional: Locale detection strategy localeDetection: true, }, // Other Next.js config... }; module.exports = nextConfig; . Step 3: Create Language Switching Component . Implement a language switcher component: . import { useRouter } from 'next/router'; import Link from 'next/link'; export default function LanguageSwitcher() { const router = useRouter(); const { locale, locales, asPath } = router; return ( &lt;div className=\"language-switcher\"&gt; &lt;ul&gt; {locales.map((l) =&gt; ( &lt;li key={l} className={l === locale ? 'active' : ''}&gt; &lt;Link href={asPath} locale={l}&gt; &lt;a&gt;{getLanguageName(l)}&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/Link&gt; &lt;/li&gt; ))} &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt; ); } function getLanguageName(locale) { const names = { en: 'English', nl: 'Nederlands', de: 'Deutsch', fr: 'Français', }; return names[locale] || locale; } . Step 4: Fetch Data with Language Context . When fetching data from Saleor, include the language code: . import { useRouter } from 'next/router'; import { gql, useQuery } from '@apollo/client'; // Map Next.js locale codes to Saleor language codes const localeToLanguageCode = { en: 'EN', nl: 'NL', de: 'DE', fr: 'FR', }; export default function ProductDetail({ productId }) { const { locale } = useRouter(); const languageCode = localeToLanguageCode[locale] || 'EN'; const GET_PRODUCT = gql` query GetProduct($id: ID!, $languageCode: LanguageCodeEnum!) { product(id: $id) { id name description translation(languageCode: $languageCode) { id name description } } } `; const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_PRODUCT, { variables: { id: productId, languageCode, }, }); if (loading) return &lt;p&gt;Loading...&lt;/p&gt;; if (error) return &lt;p&gt;Error: {error.message}&lt;/p&gt;; const product = data.product; const translatedName = product.translation?.name || product.name; const translatedDescription = product.translation?.description || product.description; return ( &lt;div&gt; &lt;h1&gt;{translatedName}&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;div&gt;{translatedDescription}&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; ); } . Step 5: Create Language-Specific Static Pages . For static pages, use Next.js’ static generation features with locale support: . // pages/about.js export default function About({ translations }) { return ( &lt;div&gt; &lt;h1&gt;{translations.title}&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;{translations.content}&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; ); } export async function getStaticProps({ locale }) { // Load translations for the specific locale const translations = await import(`../locales/${locale}/about.json`); return { props: { translations: translations.default, }, }; } . Structure your locale files like this: . /locales /en about.json /nl about.json /de about.json /fr about.json . Step 6: Implement a Translation System for UI Elements . For UI strings, use a translation library like next-i18next: . | Install the library: npm install next-i18next . | Create a shared config: // next-i18next.config.js module.exports = { i18n: { defaultLocale: 'en', locales: ['en', 'nl', 'de', 'fr'], }, }; . | Create translation files: // /public/locales/en/common.json { \"header\": { \"search\": \"Search\", \"cart\": \"Cart\", \"account\": \"Account\" }, \"footer\": { \"about\": \"About Us\", \"contact\": \"Contact\", \"terms\": \"Terms and Conditions\" } } . | Use translations in components: import { useTranslation } from 'next-i18next'; export default function Header() { const { t } = useTranslation('common'); return ( &lt;header&gt; &lt;nav&gt; &lt;a href=\"/search\"&gt;{t('header.search')}&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"/cart\"&gt;{t('header.cart')}&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"/account\"&gt;{t('header.account')}&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/nav&gt; &lt;/header&gt; ); } . | .

Verify data fetching, mutations (e.g., add to cart, checkout), and error handling. Can use tools like @testing-library/react with mock service workers (msw) or run against a live test Saleor instance. | CMS Integration: Test interactions between Next.js and the Headless CMS API for fetching content. | Saleor &lt;&gt; CMS: If there’s direct interaction (e.g., webhooks), test these flows. | . | End-to-End (E2E) Testing: . | Framework: Use Cypress or Playwright. | Scope: Simulate real user journeys across the frontend application, interacting with live (or near-live test environment) backend services (Saleor, CMS). | Key Scenarios: . | Product browsing and filtering (per channel/region). | Adding items to cart. | Full checkout process (including address entry, shipping selection, simulated payment) for each region/currency/language combination. | User login and account management. | Language switching. | Content page navigation. | . | . | Manual Testing / QA: . | Cross-Browser/Device Testing: Verify layout and functionality on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and device sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile). | Exploratory Testing: Unscripted testing to find edge cases and usability issues. | Accessibility Testing: Use tools (like Axe DevTools) and manual checks (keyboard navigation, screen reader) to ensure WCAG compliance. | Multi-Region/Language Validation: Manually verify content, pricing, currency, taxes, and language for each supported region/domain. | . | .
