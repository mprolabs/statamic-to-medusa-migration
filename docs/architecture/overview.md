## Architecture Components

### Frontend Tier
The frontend tier consists of responsive, multi-language user interfaces that interact with the backend services through the API Gateway.

- **Customer Portal**: End-user facing shopping experience
- **Admin Dashboard**: Backend management system for administrators
- **Content Management**: Interface for managing website content

### API Gateway
The API Gateway serves as the central entry point for all client applications, managing request routing, authentication, and cross-cutting concerns.

### Commerce Platform (Medusa.js)
Medusa.js provides comprehensive e-commerce functionality, replacing the previous Simple Commerce implementation.

- **Product Management**: Catalog, inventory, and product variants
- **Order Processing**: Cart, checkout, and order fulfillment
- **Customer Management**: Accounts, profiles, and order history
- **Multi-Region Support**: Region-specific pricing, taxation, and shipping

### Content Platform (Strapi)
Strapi serves as the headless CMS, replacing Statamic for content management capabilities.

- **Content Management**: Pages, articles, and media
- **Multi-Language Support**: Internationalized content for all supported regions
- **Dynamic Layouts**: Flexible content layouts and components

### Data Layer
The data layer manages all persistent data, ensuring data integrity and providing consistent access patterns.

- **Database**: Structured data storage
- **Asset Storage**: Media and document storage
- **Cache Layer**: Performance optimization through caching

### Analytics & Reporting
Features for tracking user behavior, system performance, and business metrics.

- **Event Tracking**: Region and language-aware user behavior tracking
- **Data Processing**: ETL pipelines for data transformation
- **Reporting Interface**: Business intelligence dashboards and exports

### Infrastructure
Foundation components that support the operation of the system.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Continuous integration and deployment
- **Monitoring**: System health and performance monitoring
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, and data protection

### Data Migration
Tooling to facilitate the migration from Statamic and Simple Commerce to Medusa.js and Strapi.

- **Data Extractors**: Export data from Statamic/Simple Commerce
- **Transformers**: Convert data to Medusa.js/Strapi formats
- **Validators**: Ensure data integrity during migration

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Multi-Region Support
The system supports multiple geographical regions, each with:
- Region-specific pricing and taxation
- Localized content and products
- Regional shipping and payment methods

### Multi-Language Capabilities
Full internationalization support throughout the system:
- Content available in multiple languages
- User interfaces adapted to each language
- Language-specific metadata for SEO

### Performance Optimization
The architecture incorporates several performance-enhancing features:
- Strategic caching at multiple levels
- CDN integration for static assets
- Optimized database queries and indexes

### Security
Security is embedded throughout the architecture:
- Authentication and authorization
- Data encryption
- GDPR/CCPA compliance
- Regular security audits

## Technology Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Commerce Platform | Medusa.js |
| Content Management | Strapi CMS |
| Frontend | Next.js / React |
| API | REST / GraphQL |
| Database | PostgreSQL |
| Asset Storage | AWS S3 / Cloudinary |
| Analytics | Custom solution with event tracking |
| Deployment | Docker / Kubernetes |

## System Interaction Flows

### Customer Purchase Flow
1. Customer browses products in their preferred language
2. Region-specific pricing and shipping options are displayed
3. Customer adds products to cart
4. Checkout process handles region-specific payment methods
5. Order is processed through Medusa.js
6. Customer receives confirmation

### Content Management Flow
1. Content manager creates/edits content in Strapi
2. Content is saved with multi-language variations
3. API Gateway exposes the content
4. Frontend displays content based on user language preference

## Migration Strategy

The migration from Statamic/Simple Commerce to Medusa.js/Strapi follows these stages:
1. Data extraction from source systems
2. Data transformation to target formats
3. Validation of transformed data
4. Incremental loading into target systems
5. Verification and testing
6. Cutover planning and execution
