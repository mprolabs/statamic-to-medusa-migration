# Technical Architecture Details

This document provides in-depth technical information about the architecture of the Statamic to Medusa.js migration project.

## System Architecture Components

### Frontend Tier

The frontend tier is built using Next.js, a React framework that provides server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and client-side rendering capabilities.

#### Key Components:
- **Pages**: Implements route-based components using Next.js pages router
- **Components**: Reusable UI components with styling
- **Hooks**: Custom React hooks for state management and business logic
- **Context Providers**: Global state management for regions, languages, and cart
- **API Clients**: Abstraction layer for communicating with backend services

#### Technical Choices:
- **Next.js**: Provides optimal performance through SSR/SSG capabilities
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and better developer experience
- **Styled Components**: Component-scoped styling with theme support
- **SWR**: Data fetching with caching and revalidation

### API Gateway

The API Gateway serves as a unified entry point for all client-server communications, handling authentication, routing, and request transformation.

#### Implementation Details:
- **Express.js**: Lightweight web framework for Node.js
- **Middleware Pipeline**: 
  - Authentication validation
  - Request logging and monitoring
  - Rate limiting
  - CORS handling
  - Route-specific middleware

### Analytics Platform

The analytics platform captures, processes, and visualizes user behavior and business metrics.

#### Data Collection:
- Client-side event tracking
- Server-side logging
- API request monitoring
- Error tracking

#### Data Processing:
- ETL pipelines for data transformation
- Data warehouse for aggregated metrics
- Real-time and batch processing

#### Reporting Interface:

- Region and language filtering

### Infrastructure

The infrastructure layer provides the foundation for deploying, scaling, and managing the application.

#### Docker Implementation:
- Containerized services
- Multi-stage builds for optimization
- Volume management for persistence
- Network configuration for service communication

#### Kubernetes Implementation:
- Pod deployment and scaling
- Service discovery and load balancing
- Ingress configuration
- ConfigMaps and Secrets management
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)

#### CI/CD Pipeline:
- Automated builds and testing
- Deployment automation
- Environment promotion
- Rollback capabilities

## Data Flows

### Product Catalog Flow

1. Product data is managed in Medusa.js admin
2. Enhanced content is managed in Strapi
3. Data is synchronized between systems via webhooks
4. Frontend retrieves and merges data from both systems
5. Search indexing captures product data for search functionality

### Checkout Flow

1. User adds items to cart (stored in Medusa.js)
2. Shipping options are calculated based on user region
3. Payment options are presented based on region availability
4. Order is processed through Medusa.js
5. Confirmation is sent to user
6. Order data is stored for analytics and reporting

### Content Management Flow

1. Editors create/update content in Strapi
2. Content is versioned and can be previewed
3. Published content is made available via API
4. Frontend retrieves content based on current region and language
5. Content is rendered with appropriate layouts and components

## Multi-Region Implementation

### Region Configuration

Regions are defined in Medusa.js with the following properties:
- Currency
- Tax rules
- Shipping options
- Payment providers
- Pricing
- Available languages

### Technical Implementation:

```typescript
// Region definition example
interface Region {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  currency_code: string;
  tax_code: string;
  tax_rate: number;
  countries: Country[];
  payment_providers: PaymentProvider[];
  fulfillment_providers: FulfillmentProvider[];
  languages: Language[];
}

// Region-aware product pricing
interface ProductVariantPrice {
  id: string;
  currency_code: string;
  amount: number;
  region_id: string;
  sale_amount: number | null;
  variant_id: string;
}
```

### Region Selection Logic:

1. Initial detection based on user's location (IP geolocation)
2. User can manually select a different region
3. Region preference is stored in browser storage
4. URLs can include region identifiers for direct access

## Multi-Language Implementation

### Language Configuration

Languages are configured with:
- Locale code
- Display name
- RTL/LTR direction
- Available regions

### Technical Implementation:

```typescript
// Language definition
interface Language {
  id: string;
  code: string; // ISO code
  name: string;
  native_name: string;
  direction: 'ltr' | 'rtl';
  available_in_regions: string[]; // region IDs
}

// Language context provider
const LanguageContext = createContext<{
  currentLanguage: Language;
  availableLanguages: Language[];
  setLanguage: (code: string) => void;
}>({
  currentLanguage: defaultLanguage,
  availableLanguages: [],
  setLanguage: () => {}
});
```

### Translation Strategy:

1. UI components use translation keys
2. Content from Strapi is already localized
3. Product data is managed with language variants
4. Error messages and system notifications are translated

## Security Implementation

### Authentication:

- JWT-based authentication
- OAuth integration for social login
- Session management with appropriate expiration
- CSRF protection

### Authorization:

- Role-based access control
- Permission-based restrictions
- API-level access controls

### Data Protection:

- Data encryption at rest
