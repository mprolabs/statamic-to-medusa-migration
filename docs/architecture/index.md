# System Architecture

This section provides a comprehensive view of the system architecture for the Statamic to Medusa.js migration project.

## System Components

The architecture consists of the following main components:

- **Frontend Tier**: The user-facing application built with Next.js
- **API Gateway**: Manages routing and request handling
- **Commerce Platform**: Medusa.js handles e-commerce functionality
- **Content Platform**: Strapi CMS manages content
- **Data Layer**: Database and storage systems
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud services and infrastructure components
- **Data Migration**: Components for migrating data from Statamic to Medusa.js/Strapi

## Diagrams

For visual representations of the architecture, see the [System Diagrams](diagrams/index.md) section.

## Integration Points

The system includes several key integration points:

- Frontend to API Gateway
- API Gateway to Commerce Platform and Content Platform
- Commerce Platform to Data Layer
- Content Platform to Data Layer
- Data Migration to both source and destination platforms

## Multi-Region and Multi-Language Support

The architecture is designed to support:

- **Multiple Regions**: Through distributed deployment and region-specific configurations
- **Multiple Languages**: Via content localization and translation management

## Technical Considerations

- **Scalability**: The system is designed to scale horizontally
- **Performance**: Optimized for fast response times and efficient data processing
- **Security**: Implements industry-standard security practices
- **Maintainability**: Follows clean architecture principles for easy maintenance

## Architecture Overview

Our system is built on Medusa.js, a headless commerce platform, with Strapi CMS for content management. The architecture follows a layered approach with clear separation of concerns:

- **Client Layer**: Storefront and Admin applications 
- **HTTP Layer**: Express.js-based API routes
- **Workflow Layer**: Business logic encapsulation
- **Module Layer**: Domain-specific resource management
- **Data Store Layer**: PostgreSQL and Redis databases
- **Content Platform**: Strapi CMS integration
- **Data Migration**: Tools for migrating from Statamic to Medusa.js

## Architecture Diagram

For a visual representation of our architecture, see the [Architecture Diagram](architecture-diagram.md).

## Detailed Documentation

- [HTTP Layer](http-layer.md): API Routes and Express.js implementation
- [Workflow Layer](workflow-layer.md): Business logic implementation
- [Module Layer](module-layer.md): Domain-specific modules and data models
- [Data Store Layer](data-store-layer.md): Database schema and migrations
- [Content Platform](content-platform.md): Strapi CMS integration
- [Data Migration](data-migration.md): Migration strategy and tools

## Key Architectural Decisions

- **Headless Architecture**: Separation of frontend and backend for maximum flexibility
- **Modular Design**: Domain-driven design with clearly separated modules
- **API-First**: RESTful API design for all functionality
- **Multi-Region Support**: Region-specific configurations and routing
- **Multi-Language Support**: Language handling at all layers of the architecture
- **Progressive Migration**: Phased approach to migration from Statamic

## Design Patterns

- **Repository Pattern**: For data access abstraction
- **Factory Pattern**: For creating service instances
- **Strategy Pattern**: For flexible algorithm implementations
- **Observer Pattern**: For event-driven architecture components
- **Dependency Injection**: For loose coupling and testability
