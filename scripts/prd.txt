# Overview  
This project involves migrating an existing e-commerce platform from Statamic CMS with Simple Commerce to a headless commerce solution using Medusa.js and Strapi CMS. The migration will enhance multi-region and multi-language capabilities, specifically supporting three domains (Netherlands, Belgium, Germany) with Dutch and German language support. The project aims to preserve essential functionality while adding new capabilities through the migration.

# Core Features  
## Multi-Region E-commerce
- Support for three separate domains (example.nl, example.be, example.de)
- Region-specific product availability, pricing, taxes, and payment methods
- Domain-based routing and content delivery
- Region detection and switching capabilities

## Multi-Language Support
- Support for Dutch (nl) and German (de) languages
- Language-specific content in both Medusa.js and Strapi
- Language detection and switching capabilities
- Fallback mechanisms for missing translations

## Headless Commerce Architecture
- Medusa.js for commerce functionality (products, orders, customers)
- Strapi CMS for content management (pages, blogs, extended product content)
- Integration layer to ensure data consistency between systems
- Next.js frontend for storefront implementation

## Data Migration
- Extraction of data from Statamic and Simple Commerce
- Transformation and loading into Medusa.js and Strapi
- Preservation of multi-language content
- Handling of region-specific configurations

# User Experience  
## Customer Personas
- Dutch customers shopping on example.nl
- Belgian customers shopping on example.be
- German customers shopping on example.de
- Administrators managing products and content across all regions

## Key User Flows
- Browsing products with region-specific pricing and availability
- Switching languages while maintaining region context
- Checkout with region-specific payment and shipping options
- Content browsing with appropriate language and regional relevance

# Technical Architecture  
## System Components
- **Medusa.js Core**: Headless commerce engine handling products, orders, customers
- **Medusa.js Region Module**: Configuration for NL, BE, DE regions with appropriate settings
- **Medusa.js Sales Channels**: Control product availability across regions
- **Strapi CMS**: Content management with i18n plugin for multi-language support
- **Integration Service**: Synchronization between Medusa.js and Strapi
- **Next.js Frontend**: Multi-domain storefront with region and language support
- **API Gateway**: Unified API layer for frontend to backend communication

## Data Models
- **Region Configuration**: Domain-specific settings, currencies, taxes, payment providers
- **Product Model**: Core product data with multi-region pricing and multi-language metadata
- **Content Types**: Strapi schemas with translatable fields and region availability
- **Integration Model**: Reference system between Medusa.js and Strapi entities

## APIs and Integrations
- **Medusa.js Admin & Store APIs**: Commerce functionality endpoints
- **Strapi Content API**: Content management endpoints
- **Integration Webhooks**: Event-based synchronization between systems
- **External Services**: Payment gateways, shipping providers, analytics

## Infrastructure Requirements
- **Medusa.js Server**: Node.js application with PostgreSQL database
- **Strapi Server**: Node.js application with PostgreSQL database
- **Next.js Deployment**: Static generation with SSR capabilities
- **Redis**: Caching layer for performance optimization
- **CDN**: Content delivery network for static assets and pages
- **Domain Routing**: Configuration for multiple domains

# Development Roadmap  
## Phase 1: Assessment and Proof of Concept
- Document multi-region architecture design
- Design data models for Medusa.js and Strapi
- Create data migration mapping strategy
- Set up Medusa.js POC with multi-region support
- Set up Strapi POC with multi-language support
- Develop initial migration scripts
- Create simple Next.js frontend with region detection

## Phase 2: Development Environment Setup
- Configure complete development environment
- Set up Next.js with multi-domain support
- Implement integration layer between Medusa.js and Strapi
- Set up testing framework for multi-region validation
- Create comprehensive region and language configuration

## Phase 3: Data Migration
- Extract product data from Statamic/Simple Commerce
- Transform and load products into Medusa.js
- Extract content data from Statamic
- Transform and load content into Strapi
- Implement data validation and migration monitoring
- Test data integrity across all regions and languages

## Phase 4: Frontend Development
- Develop core components with multi-region support
- Implement language switching functionality
- Create region-specific features (shipping, payments, taxes)
- Build product browsing with region-aware pricing
- Implement checkout flow with region-specific options
- Create comprehensive testing for all region/language combinations

# Logical Dependency Chain
1. **Architecture Definition**: Must establish multi-region architecture before implementation
2. **Data Model Design**: Required before any data migration can begin
3. **Proof of Concept Implementation**: Validates the approach before full development
4. **Development Environment**: Needed for implementing and testing all features
5. **Data Migration**: Required to have real data for testing and validation
6. **Integration Layer**: Ensures data consistency between systems
7. **Frontend Implementation**: Builds upon the backend systems and migrated data
8. **Testing Framework**: Validates functionality across all region/language combinations

# Risks and Mitigations  
## Technical Challenges
- **Risk**: Complex multi-region configuration in Medusa.js
  **Mitigation**: Create detailed region configuration guide and validate with POC

- **Risk**: Data loss during migration from Statamic
  **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive data validation and provide rollback capability

- **Risk**: Performance issues with multi-region implementation
  **Mitigation**: Implement caching strategies and optimize database queries

## Multi-Region Complexity
- **Risk**: Inconsistent behavior across regions
  **Mitigation**: Create parameterized tests for all region/language combinations

- **Risk**: Region-specific customizations becoming unmanageable
  **Mitigation**: Implement a modular approach to region-specific features

## Integration Challenges
- **Risk**: Data inconsistency between Medusa.js and Strapi
  **Mitigation**: Create robust bidirectional synchronization with error handling

- **Risk**: Complex deployment across multiple domains
  **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with region-specific testing

# Appendix  
## Current System Analysis
- Statamic CMS with Simple Commerce plugin
- Multi-region implemented through domain-specific configuration
- Multi-language content stored in separate files
- Custom fields for region-specific product data

## Technology Selection Rationale
- Medusa.js selected for robust multi-region e-commerce capabilities
- Strapi chosen for powerful content management with i18n support
- Next.js selected for multi-domain routing and SSR/SSG capabilities
- PostgreSQL chosen for data storage due to compatibility with both systems
