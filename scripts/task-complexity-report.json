      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Define Saleor Migration Architecture",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the architecture documentation into subtasks covering: (1) drafting a high-level system diagram, (2) detailing each core component (Next.js storefront, Saleor GraphQL API, data migration tools), (3) documenting multi-region support using Saleor Channels, (4) specifying the multi-language handling approach with Saleor's translation API, and (5) reviewing for completeness and alignment with business requirements.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires a deep understanding of both the current and target architectures, including multi-region and multi-language complexities. It involves synthesizing information from multiple systems and ensuring the architecture is scalable and maintainable, which adds significant complexity.[2][7][9]"
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Design Data Migration Models",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the data migration modeling into: (1) documenting current Statamic/Simple Commerce data models, (2) defining equivalent Saleor data models, (3) mapping entities between the two systems, (4) specifying transformation and migration rules (including multi-language content), and (5) validating the mapping with sample data.",
      "reasoning": "Data migration is inherently complex due to the need for accurate mapping, transformation, and preservation of data integrity, especially with multi-language support. The process must handle schema differences, data normalization, and ensure zero downtime if possible.[5][9]"
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Establish API Specifications",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down API specification into: (1) defining API endpoints and HTTP methods, (2) specifying request/response schemas and payloads, (3) documenting authentication and authorization mechanisms, and (4) creating OpenAPI/Swagger documentation including rate limiting and security considerations.",
      "reasoning": "Defining robust API specifications is critical for system integration and security. It requires careful planning for extensibility, security, and documentation, ensuring all internal and external needs are met and standardized.[6][7]"
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Set Up Infrastructure Requirements",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose infrastructure setup into: (1) specifying cloud provider and environment requirements, (2) documenting compute, storage, and networking needs, (3) defining CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure-as-code templates, and (4) setting up monitoring and logging infrastructure.",
      "reasoning": "Infrastructure planning is moderately complex, involving cloud architecture, scalability, deployment pipelines, and operational monitoring. It must anticipate future scaling and reliability needs.[2][9]"
    },

      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Migrate to Nimara E-commerce Framework",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Segment the migration into: (1) setting up the Nimara codebase, (2) porting custom multi-region functionality, (3) porting multi-language support, (4) integrating with Saleor backend, and (5) validating feature parity and regression testing.",
      "reasoning": "Migrating to a new framework while preserving customizations for regions and languages is challenging. It requires careful porting, integration, and thorough testing to avoid regressions and maintain business logic.[9]"
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Develop User Interface for MVP",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break UI development into: (1) implementing core UI components based on UX requirements, (2) developing critical user flows, (3) ensuring responsive and accessible design, and (4) establishing a component-based architecture for extensibility.",
      "reasoning": "UI development for MVP requires balancing speed and quality, ensuring usability, accessibility, and maintainability. The focus on extensibility and responsiveness adds moderate complexity.[7][10]"
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Authentication and Authorization",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide security implementation into: (1) developing user registration and login flows, (2) setting up role-based access control, (3) integrating with authentication providers and secure password handling, and (4) implementing session management and token-based authentication.",
      "reasoning": "Authentication and authorization are critical for security and compliance. Implementing secure flows, RBAC, and integration with providers requires careful design and testing to prevent vulnerabilities.[6]"
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Integration Points",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down integration work into: (1) creating adapters for each external system, (2) implementing error handling and retry logic, (3) adding caching and fallback mechanisms, and (4) documenting integration points with sequence diagrams.",
      "reasoning": "Integrating with external systems involves handling diverse APIs, error scenarios, and ensuring reliability. Proper abstraction and documentation are essential for maintainability and troubleshooting.[3][6]"

      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Monitoring and Logging",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide monitoring and logging setup into: (1) implementing application and audit logging, (2) configuring performance monitoring and health checks, and (3) setting up alerting for critical issues.",
      "reasoning": "Monitoring and logging are essential for operational visibility and security, but implementation is straightforward with modern tools. The main complexity is ensuring coverage and actionable alerts.[2][4]"
