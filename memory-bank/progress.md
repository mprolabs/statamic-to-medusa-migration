## Current Status

The project has moved from initial planning to implementing a proof of concept. The initial assessment revealed a confidence level of approximately 92% in the migration approach. Following our architecture and testing strategy decisions, we now have greater clarity on implementation approach.

Our selected architecture (Single Medusa Instance with Region Module and Edge Caching) provides a balance between development complexity, cost-effectiveness, and performance optimization. The comprehensive testing strategy ensures we can validate all region and language combinations effectively.

Current activities include:

1. Implementing test instances of Medusa.js and Strapi
2. Testing integration patterns between these systems
3. Evaluating the Solace Medusa Starter as a potential foundation
4. Implementing proof-of-concept code for our selected architecture
5. Setting up BDD testing framework for validation
6. Testing multi-region capabilities in Medusa.js
7. Evaluating Strapi's localization features
8. Validating solutions to our key migration concerns:
   - Data model differences
   - Ecommerce functionality gaps
   - URL structure preservation
   - User data migration approaches
   - Integration compatibility
   - Multi-region support for 3 domains
   - Multi-language support for 2 languages
   - Cross-domain functionality

## Known Issues

Several challenges have been identified that we are specifically addressing in the proof of concept:

1. **Data Model Differences**: Testing how well Strapi content models can map to Statamic's structure, and how Medusa.js handles product data
2. **Ecommerce Functionality Gap Analysis**: Validating that Medusa.js can handle all required commerce features
3. **URL Structure Preservation**: Exploring Next.js routing capabilities to maintain SEO
4. **User Data Migration**: Identifying secure approaches for user data transfer
5. **Integration Compatibility**: Testing integration patterns between Medusa.js and Strapi
6. **Multi-Region Implementation**: Implementing Medusa's Region Module with our architecture decisions
7. **Language Implementation**: Testing Strapi's localization capabilities with our middleware approach
8. **Cross-Domain Authentication**: Ensuring consistent user experience across domains
9. **SEO Preservation**: Maintaining SEO value across multiple domains and languages
10. **Edge Caching Configuration**: Finding optimal caching strategies for multi-region setup

## Metrics and Progress Indicators

As we progress through the proof of concept, we're tracking:

- Completion of POC implementation tasks (currently ~35%)
- Implementation of architecture decisions (currently ~25%)
- Setup of testing framework (currently ~20%)
- Issues encountered during implementation (currently tracking 0 major issues)
- Confidence level in migration approach (targeting 95%+, currently at ~92%)
- Multi-region functionality validation (initial testing phase)
- Multi-language functionality validation (initial testing phase)

After completing the proof of concept, we'll make a formal go/no-go decision on proceeding with the full migration based on our findings, with special attention to the multi-region and multi-language requirements.

This progress file will continue to be updated as the proof of concept progresses.
