## Challenges & Solutions

### Current Challenges
1. **Migration Strategy**: Determining the most efficient way to migrate our custom code to Nimara
   - Solution: Following a phased approach with clear priorities

2. **Preserving Multi-region Logic**: Ensuring our complex multi-region implementation works within Nimara
   - Solution: Identifying clean extension points in Nimara for our custom logic

3. **Component Adaptation**: Adapting our components to use shadcn/ui
   - Solution: Creating a component migration map and refactoring incrementally

### Resolved Challenges
1. **Framework Selection**: Deciding whether to use a ready-made solution vs. custom implementation
   - Solution: Thorough analysis of Nimara leading to adoption for its production-readiness and Saleor integration
