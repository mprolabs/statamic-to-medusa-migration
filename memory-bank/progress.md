   - Documented region configuration for NL, BE, and DE
   - Established multi-language implementation for Dutch, German, French, and English
   - Developed sales channel configuration for regional product availability
   - Created caching strategy for performance optimization

3. **Migration Planning**
   - Developed detailed field-level mapping between Statamic/Simple Commerce and Medusa.js/Strapi
   - Created comprehensive validation rules for migration data integrity
   - Implemented field mapping generation script with JSON output
   - Developed validation script to ensure mapping consistency
   - Created region-specific field mapping for Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany
   - Documented multi-language field mapping for all supported locales
   - Outlined data transformation rules for different field types

## Architecture Decisions
- ✅ Selected **Single Medusa Instance with Region Module and Edge Caching** approach
- ✅ Defined region configuration schema for all three domains
- ✅ Designed language handling middleware implementation
- ✅ Specified domain-specific routing strategy
- ✅ Documented CDN/edge caching approach for performance optimization
- ✅ Created implementation roadmap for POC validation

## Testing Strategy Decisions
- ✅ Selected **Centralized Testing Framework with BDD Methodology**
- ✅ Designed test matrix covering all region/language combinations
- ✅ Created example BDD test scenarios for critical flows
- ✅ Defined test configuration for regional settings
- ✅ Established test execution strategy with focused and comprehensive runs

## What's Left to Build

1. **Proof of Concept Implementation**
   - Set up Medusa.js with Region Module for multi-region support
   - Configure Strapi with i18n plugin for multi-language content
   - Create simple Next.js frontend with region detection
   - Implement language switching functionality
   - Test integration between all components

2. **Data Migration Tools**
   - Develop data extraction scripts for Statamic/Simple Commerce
   - Create transformation pipelines for Medusa.js import
   - Build content migration tools for Strapi
   - Implement region and language mapping utilities
   - Test with sample data sets

3. **Integration Layer**
   - Build bi-directional synchronization between Medusa.js and Strapi
   - Implement webhook-based update system
   - Create entity relationship mapping
   - Develop error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Set up monitoring for integration health

4. **Frontend Implementation**
   - Develop Next.js storefront with multi-domain support
   - Create region context provider and hooks
   - Implement language selection components
   - Build region-specific checkout flows
   - Develop content components for Strapi integration

5. **Testing Framework**
   - Implement BDD testing framework with Cypress
   - Create parameterized tests for region/language combinations
   - Develop visual regression testing
   - Build performance testing suite
   - Create end-to-end test scenarios

## Current Status

The project is currently in the proof of concept phase, with a focus on validating the architectural decisions for multi-region and multi-language support. Documentation has been established, including detailed architectural patterns, Strapi schema definitions, and migration strategies. Field-level mapping and validation tools have been implemented to ensure data integrity during the migration process. We've recently enhanced the validation scripts with improved error handling and support for complex data types, particularly for pricing and product variants.

### Key Accomplishments

- Completed documentation of multi-region architecture
- Established Strapi schema with multi-language support
- Created comprehensive field-level mapping for Statamic to Medusa.js/Strapi migration
- Implemented data validation scripts to ensure mapping consistency
- Developed region-specific configuration for all three target domains
- Expanded language support to include Dutch, German, French, and English
- Created transformation rules for different field types and formats
- Designed integration patterns between Medusa.js and Strapi
- Developed region-specific configuration guidelines
- Created comprehensive testing strategy for all region/language combinations
- Synced TaskMaster tasks with migration-specific focus
- Fixed and enhanced validation scripts for improved error handling
- Implemented robust validation for pricing data with currency format verification
- Created comprehensive validation reporting with both JSON and text outputs
- Added support for validating complex product variants with region-specific attributes
- Improved error reporting with detailed location and context information

### Pending Actions

- Implement Medusa.js proof of concept with Region Module
- Set up Strapi with i18n support
- Create basic Next.js frontend with region detection
- Test data migration with sample datasets
- Validate integration patterns with prototype implementation
- Perform performance testing on the multi-region architecture

## Known Issues

1. **Region-Based Price Management**
   - Need to finalize how region-specific pricing will be implemented in Medusa.js
   - Currently exploring price list options vs. region-specific variants

2. **Cross-Domain Authentication**
   - Need to address session persistence across different regional domains
   - Investigating JWT-based authentication with domain sharing

3. **Content Synchronization**
   - Need to finalize the bidirectional sync approach between Medusa.js and Strapi
   - Determining the best webhook configuration for reliable updates

4. **Region-Specific SEO**
   - Need to implement strategy for region-specific metadata
   - Ensuring proper canonical URLs across regional domains

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Need to validate caching strategy with actual implementation
   - Determining optimal database query patterns for region filtering

## Metrics and Progress Indicators

As we progress through the proof of concept, we're tracking:

- Completion of POC implementation tasks (currently ~35%)
- Implementation of architecture decisions (currently ~25%)
- Setup of testing framework (currently ~20%)
- Issues encountered during implementation (currently tracking 0 major issues)
- Confidence level in migration approach (targeting 95%+, currently at ~92%)
- Multi-region functionality validation (initial testing phase)
- Multi-language functionality validation (initial testing phase)

After completing the proof of concept, we'll make a formal go/no-go decision on proceeding with the full migration based on our findings, with special attention to the multi-region and multi-language requirements.

This progress file will continue to be updated as the proof of concept progresses.
