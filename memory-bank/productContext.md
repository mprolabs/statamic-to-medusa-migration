# Product Context: Statamic to Saleor Migration

## Why This Migration

The current Statamic-based website with Simple Commerce functionality has served its purpose but is facing several limitations:

1. **Performance Challenges**: The PHP-based architecture has inherent performance limitations, resulting in longer page load times and reduced user experience.

2. **Scalability Concerns**: As the product catalog and user base grow, the current system is becoming increasingly difficult to scale efficiently.

3. **Limited Headless Capabilities**: Statamic, while flexible as a CMS, doesn't provide true headless architecture that modern frontend implementations benefit from.

4. **Ecommerce Feature Constraints**: Simple Commerce provides basic ecommerce functionality but lacks the advanced features offered by dedicated ecommerce solutions.

5. **Development Velocity**: Adding new features and maintaining the current codebase requires specialized PHP/Laravel knowledge and often involves complex customizations.

6. **Multi-Region Limitations**: The current setup struggles to efficiently support multiple domains with region-specific configurations and content.

7. **Language Management Challenges**: Managing multilingual content in the current system is cumbersome and lacks efficient workflows.
