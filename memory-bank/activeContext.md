   - Configuring Medusa.js with region-specific settings for all domains
   - Developing the language middleware for request handling
   - Structuring Strapi with multi-site and localization capabilities
   - Setting up edge caching strategy for region-specific optimization

2. **Testing Framework Setup**
   - Implementing the **Centralized Testing Framework with BDD Methodology**
   - Creating test scenarios covering all region/language combinations
   - Developing parameterized test configuration
   - Setting up visual regression testing capabilities
   - Establishing test execution strategy for development and CI/CD

3. **Proof of Concept Implementation**
   - Setting up test instances of Medusa.js and Strapi
   - Testing integration between these systems
   - Evaluating the Solace Medusa Starter as a foundation
   - Validating that the selected architecture can handle key requirements
   - Testing multi-region capabilities with Medusa's Region Module
   - Evaluating multi-language support with Strapi's localization features

4. **Current System Analysis**
   - Analyzing the existing Statamic site structure and data models
   - Documenting key ecommerce features and functionality
   - Identifying custom implementations and third-party integrations
   - Analyzing current language implementation (if any)
   - Documenting domain-specific configurations

5. **Address Key Migration Concerns**
   - Validating solutions for data model differences
   - Confirming ecommerce functionality coverage
   - Testing URL structure preservation techniques
   - Evaluating user data migration approaches
   - Assessing integration compatibility
   - Implementing multi-region capabilities with the selected architecture
   - Testing language persistence and switching with the middleware approach
   - Ensuring SEO preservation across domains and languages

6. **Technical Validation**
   - Confirming that Medusa.js meets commerce requirements
   - Verifying that Strapi can handle content management needs
   - Testing integration patterns between the systems
   - Evaluating performance characteristics with edge caching
   - Implementing region and language configuration based on architecture decisions
   - Testing cross-domain functionality

## Current Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- Selected **Single Medusa Instance with Region Module and Edge Caching** approach after evaluating multiple options
- Designed region configuration schema covering all domains (nl, be, de)
- Created language middleware design for request handling and language detection
- Decided to use CDN/edge caching for region-specific performance optimization
- Confirmed direction to use a headless architecture with separate commerce and content services
- Will use Next.js as the frontend framework with region/language routing
- Established data modeling approach with region and language fields
- Will implement Strapi with multi-site capability and i18n plugin
- Will implement domain-specific routing through API Gateway

### Testing Strategy Decisions
- Selected **Centralized Testing Framework with BDD Methodology** after evaluating multiple approaches
- Will implement Cypress with parameterization for region and language variants
- Will structure tests using Gherkin syntax for business readability
- Designed test matrix covering all region/language combinations
- Created test configuration with region-specific test data
- Will implement visual regression testing for key interfaces
- Established test execution strategy with focused and comprehensive test runs

### Proof of Concept Goals
- Implement selected architecture in limited scope
- Set up testing framework with example test scenarios
- Validate that Medusa.js can handle the required ecommerce functionality
- Confirm that Strapi can effectively manage the content aspects
- Test the integration patterns between systems
- Evaluate the Solace Medusa Starter as a foundation
- Identify any potential limitations or concerns
- Test multi-region configuration in Medusa.js
- Validate Strapi's localization capabilities
- Test language switching and persistence
- Verify domain-specific configurations

### Development Workflow Considerations
- Exploring phased vs. complete rebuild approaches through POC
- Testing development workflows within each system
- Evaluating integration patterns and data synchronization
- Testing content translation workflows
- Evaluating domain-specific development processes

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Architecture Decisions**
   - Set up Medusa.js with the Region Module configuration as designed
   - Implement language middleware prototype for request handling
   - Configure Strapi with multi-site capability and i18n plugin

## Open Questions

1. What are the performance implications of the Single Medusa Instance approach compared to multiple instances?
2. How will CDN/edge caching be configured to optimize for region-specific content?
3. What is the most efficient approach for language fallback when content is missing in a specific language?
4. How can we optimize the testing matrix to cover all critical scenarios without excessive test execution time?
5. What is the optimal deployment architecture for the integrated systems?
6. How will user accounts and authentication work across multiple domains?
7. What are the SEO implications of our language handling approach?
8. How will we handle region-specific payment provider integrations?
9. What is the optimal database schema for storing region and language variants?
10. How will we handle cross-region analytics and reporting?

This active context will be updated as the proof of concept progresses and we implement our architecture and testing strategy decisions.
