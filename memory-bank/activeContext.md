# Active Context: Statamic to Medusa.js Migration

## Current Focus

We are currently focused on implementing and enhancing the data validation system for the Statamic to Medusa.js migration project. Specifically, we're fixing bugs in the validation scripts, enhancing validation rules for complex data types, and ensuring proper error handling during the validation and import process. The proof of concept phase is progressing with a focus on validating the core architectural patterns and ensuring data integrity.

### Current Challenges

1. **Region-Based Price Management**: 
   - Implementing an efficient way to manage price variations across regions
   - Creating appropriate price list structures in Medusa.js

2. **Cross-Domain Authentication**:
   - Ensuring seamless authentication across different regional domains
   - Maintaining user sessions when switching regions

3. **Content Synchronization**:
   - Creating a reliable bidirectional sync between Medusa.js and Strapi
   - Handling region-specific content efficiently

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implementing appropriate caching strategies for multi-region setups
   - Optimizing API calls when retrieving region-specific data

## Next Steps

### Short-term (1-2 weeks)

1. **Complete Data Validation System**:
   - Add more specific validators for different entity types
   - Implement cross-field validation rules
   - Add performance optimizations for validation of large datasets
   - Create unit tests for validation system
   - Document validation rules for all entity types

2. **Proof of Concept Implementation**:
   - Set up a basic Medusa.js instance with multi-region configuration
   - Configure Strapi with appropriate content types and i18n support
   - Create a simple Next.js frontend that demonstrates region switching
   - Test region-specific configuration with sample products

3. **Data Migration Testing**:
   - Test the migration scripts with sample Statamic data
   - Validate proper transfer of multi-language content
   - Ensure region-specific configurations are correctly migrated
   - Verify validation rules are enforced during migration

4. **Integration Layer Development**:
   - Begin implementing the integration service between Medusa.js and Strapi
   - Set up webhooks for bi-directional synchronization
   - Test the integration with product creation/updates
   - Ensure proper handling of region and language variants

### Medium-term (3-4 weeks)

1. **Frontend Development**:
   - Implement the region context provider in Next.js
   - Create components for region selection and language switching
   - Develop region-specific templates for product displays

2. **Advanced Region Features**:
   - Implement region-specific shipping and payment options
   - Set up region-based tax configurations
   - Test checkout flows across different regions

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Load test the multi-region implementation
   - Optimize database queries for region-specific data
   - Implement appropriate caching strategies

## Key Decisions

1. **Domain-Based Region Structure**:
   - We will use separate domains for each region (example.nl, example.be, example.de)
   - Each domain will be mapped to a specific Medusa.js region and sales channel
   - Region detection will be primarily based on domain, with user preference as a fallback

2. **Translation Strategy**:
   - Essential product data (title, description) will be stored in Medusa.js metadata
   - Extended content will be managed through Strapi's i18n system
   - The frontend will retrieve content from both systems based on the current language

3. **Integration Architecture**:
   - A separate integration service will handle synchronization between Medusa.js and Strapi
   - Webhooks will be used for event-based updates
   - A common ID system will be maintained for entity relationships

4. **Migration Approach**:
   - Migration will be done in phases, starting with product data
   - Region-specific configurations will be migrated in a second phase
   - Content and media assets will be migrated in a final phase

## Open Questions

1. What are the performance implications of the Single Medusa Instance approach compared to multiple instances?
2. How will CDN/edge caching be configured to optimize for region-specific content?
3. What is the most efficient approach for language fallback when content is missing in a specific language?
4. How can we optimize the testing matrix to cover all critical scenarios without excessive test execution time?
5. What is the optimal deployment architecture for the integrated systems?
6. How will user accounts and authentication work across multiple domains?
7. What are the SEO implications of our language handling approach?
8. How will we handle region-specific payment provider integrations?
9. What is the optimal database schema for storing region and language variants?
10. How will we handle cross-region analytics and reporting?

This active context will be updated as the proof of concept progresses and we implement our architecture and testing strategy decisions.
