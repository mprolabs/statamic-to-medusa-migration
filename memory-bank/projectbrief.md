# Statamic to Medusa.js Migration Project Brief

## Project Overview
This project involves migrating an existing Statamic CMS website with Simple Commerce functionality to a modern headless commerce solution using Medusa.js for ecommerce and Strapi as the headless CMS. The goal is to create a faster, more scalable, and better-performing solution while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Current System
- Statamic CMS-based website (PHP)
- Simple Commerce for ecommerce functionality
- Located in the `/public_html` directory
- Standard Laravel-based architecture
- Current website includes products, categories, user accounts, and checkout functionality

## Target Solution
- Medusa.js headless commerce engine
- Strapi headless CMS for content management
- Solace Medusa Starter as potential foundation (https://github.com/rigby-sh/solace-medusa-starter)
- Modern, API-first architecture
- Improved performance and user experience
- Multi-region support for 3 separate domains/stores
- Multi-language support for 2 languages across all stores

## Core Requirements

### Data Migration
- Migrate all product data from Statamic/Simple Commerce to Medusa.js
- Transfer content (pages, blog posts, etc.) to Strapi CMS
- Preserve user accounts and order history
- Maintain SEO values (URLs, metadata, etc.)
- Ensure data integrity throughout the migration process
- Preserve language variants from existing content

### Functionality
- Implement comprehensive ecommerce features with Medusa.js
- Set up content management in Strapi
- Recreate all existing user-facing features
- Maintain or improve current checkout flow
- Integrate payment providers currently used on the site
- Support region-specific configurations (currencies, taxes, payment providers)
- Enable language switching across all storefronts

### Multi-Region and Multi-Language Support
- Support 3 distinct domains with separate ecommerce stores
- Enable 2 languages across all stores
- Implement region-specific configurations for each domain
- Set up localized content management in Strapi
- Configure sales channels for product availability per store
- Maintain SEO value across all domains and language variants

### Technical Implementation
- Node.js-based backend (Medusa.js)
- Modern frontend framework (likely React-based)
- RESTful or GraphQL API architecture
- Proper data modeling across both systems
- Efficient database design
- Leveraging Medusa's Region Module and Sales Channels
- Implementing Strapi's multi-site capability and localization

## Project Goals
- Create a faster, more responsive user experience
- Improve site performance metrics
- Enable more flexible content management
- Provide better ecommerce capabilities
- Ensure seamless migration with minimal disruption
- Set up a more maintainable and scalable architecture
- Support multi-region and multi-language commerce

## Success Criteria
- All existing data successfully migrated
- Feature parity with current site
- Improved performance metrics (load times, Time to Interactive)
- Successful integration between Medusa.js and Strapi
- Complete documentation of the new system
- Smooth transition for both administrators and end users
- Fully functional multi-region and multi-language support
