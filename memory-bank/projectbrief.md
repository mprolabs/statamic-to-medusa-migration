# Project Brief: Statamic to Saleor Migration

## Overview
This project involves migrating from our current Statamic CMS with Simple Commerce to Saleor, focusing on multi-region and multi-language support. The project aims to preserve the existing functionality while adding new capabilities through the transition to a headless commerce architecture.

## Key Requirements

### Multi-Region Support
- Support for 3 separate domains/stores:
  - Netherlands (nl.domain.com)
  - Belgium (be.domain.com)
  - Germany (de.domain.com)
- Region-specific configurations for:
  - Currencies (EUR)
  - Tax rates and rules
  - Payment providers
  - Shipping options
  - Product availability
  - Pricing

### Multi-Language Support
- Support for content in multiple languages:
  - Dutch (primary for NL/BE)
  - German (primary for DE)
  - Language variants should be maintained across regions
- Language-specific URLs and SEO optimization
- Ability to add more languages in the future

### Headless Architecture
- Clear separation between frontend and backend
- API-first approach with GraphQL
- Scalable infrastructure that can handle region-specific traffic

### Data Migration
- Complete migration of all product data from Statamic/Simple Commerce
- Preservation of all product relationships, variants, and attributes
- Migration of customer data and order history
- Support for historical order viewing
