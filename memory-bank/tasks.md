## Current Focus

Our current focus is on the **Proof of Concept** phase, specifically working on tasks 1.4-1.9. These tasks will:

1. Validate the technical feasibility of using Medusa.js and Strapi as the migration target
2. Test the integration capabilities between these systems
3. Evaluate the Solace Medusa Starter as a potential foundation
4. Verify multi-region capabilities in Medusa.js
5. Test multi-language support in Strapi
6. Address the key concerns identified in our analysis:
   - Data model differences
   - Ecommerce functionality gaps
   - URL structure preservation
   - User data migration approaches
   - Integration compatibility
   - Multi-region support for 3 domains
   - Multi-language support for 2 languages
   - Cross-domain functionality and user experience

This practical validation will raise our confidence level from the current ~92% to the target 95%+ before proceeding with the full migration plan.

## Next Steps

After completing the current proof of concept tasks:
1. Evaluate the results against our requirements
2. Make a go/no-go decision on the migration approach
3. If proceeding, complete the remaining Phase 1 tasks
4. Develop a detailed migration plan and timeline
5. Include specific plans for multi-region and multi-language implementation

## Notes and Decisions

- Decision to use Medusa.js and Strapi for the migration target (being validated with POC)
- Initial assessment suggests that the Solace Medusa Starter may provide a good foundation
- Implementing POC to achieve 95%+ confidence in migration approach
- Need to determine whether to migrate data incrementally or all at once
- Current focus on practical validation through test implementations
- Decided to use a single Medusa.js instance with Region Module and Sales Channels
- Will use Strapi with multi-site capability and localization features
- Will create separate Next.js applications for each domain/storefront

This tasks file will be updated as the project progresses and more detailed tasks are defined.
