# Statamic to Saleor Migration

A comprehensive migration project for converting a Statamic CMS with Simple Commerce to Saleor with multi-region and multi-language support.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on migrating an existing e-commerce site from Statamic CMS to Saleor while preserving essential functionality and adding new capabilities:

- **Multi-region support**: Localized pricing, shipping, and tax calculations via Saleor Channels
- **Multi-language support**: Content translation across all supported regions
- **Headless architecture**: Separation of frontend and backend concerns

## Tech Stack

### Current (Source)
- **Statamic CMS**: Content management
- **Simple Commerce**: E-commerce functionality
- **Frontend**: Vue.js-based frontend integrated with Statamic

### Target (Destination)
- **Saleor**: Headless GraphQL commerce platform with built-in CMS capabilities
- **Frontend**: Next.js-based storefront

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available in the `/docs` directory, which includes:

- Architecture diagrams and technical details
- Migration process guides
- Implementation guides for key features
